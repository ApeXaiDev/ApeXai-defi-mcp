**ApeXai Risk Intelligence Server**  
This ApeXai module delivers a DeFi risk intelligence score derived from key input metrics including collateral ratio, asset liquidity, volatility, and optionally, market capitalization.

### Purpose  
ApeXaiâ€™s risk server enables users to evaluate DeFi positions by offering a clear, quantifiable risk score. This tool is designed to assist users in making better-informed investment decisions across decentralized financial platforms.

### Usage  

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI and Uvicorn

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Start the server using:

```bash
uvicorn apexaidefi_risk:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Query the API via a GET request at `/apexai/defi/risk` with these parameters:

- `collateral_ratio`: Ratio of collateral to loan value
- `liquidity`: Liquidity metric of the asset
- `volatility`: Asset's price volatility
- `market_cap` (optional): Asset's market capitalization

```
